### What is Ghoul Engine?
Ghoul Engine is a project where I am learning OpenGL and just figuring some stuff out (I want to maybe make some sort of object renderer with this or something).

## Project status
Currently I have just finished enough of [Pentagram](https://github.com/ShoweryCellar34/Pentagram.git) (my application framework) to start working on this again.

## How to clone
run this command with [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed to clone this repository:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ShoweryCellar34/Ghoul-Engine.git
```
